                <p>Genshin Impact was released  on the 28th of September, 2020. Ever since, it has been one of the best and most played games around the world. Genshin is a open-world role play game where you follow the story of an unknown traveller from another world who is stuck in the world of Teyvat and is searching for their lost sibling. During your journey around the world of Teyvat, you will come across a lot of different people and they will try and assist you with finding your lost sibling. </p>
                <p>In this game, you can beat enemies, level up your characters, and more. There is also a gacha system in this game which you can use to get new characters and weapons. The more stars your character has, the rarer they are. The highest rarity in Genshin Impact is a 5-star character. Usually 5-stars are far superior compared to 4-star characters but some 4-stars can either be on the same level as a 5-star character or maybe even better. May it be through damage or through supportive capabilities, any character is good enough for you to put in your team. </p>

                <h2>Gameplay and the Gacha System</h2>
                <h5>Genshin is more of a team-based game where you utilize your team of characters to their utmost power. Your team can have a maximum of 4 characters. Every character has a Vision which gives them powers for a specific elemtent. These elements are Hydro(Water), Pyro(Fire), Electro(Electricity/Thunder), Cryo(Ice), Geo(Earth/Ground), Anemo(Wind), and Dendro(Grass).So far, the majority of the characters that have been released have a Pyro Vision while there are no current Dendro characters in the game.</h5>

                <p>Moving on to the gacha system. Genshin's gacha system is quite unique being that there are 2 different currencies. Those two being the "Intertwined Fates" and the "Acquaint Fates". The Acquaint fates are used to pull on the beginner's banner and the standard banner while the Intertwined fates are used to pull on the event and weapon banners. Genshin's gacha system also has a pity system which most gacha games also have. A pity system ensures that you get a certain rarity in a set amount of pulls. In Genshin's case, 90 pulls for a guaranteed 5-star. We also get a guaranteed 4-star or higher rarity character/weapon in a single 10 pull.</p>
